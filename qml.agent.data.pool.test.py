## Text-based User Interface (TUI) Demo Guide for NFL Data Analysis

**Note: This is a TUI demo guide. Please interact with it as described below.**

You are now in the TUI mode. Below are the commands you can issue:

- `select [filename]`: To select a file for in-depth analysis.
- `go back`: To go back to the previous directory.
- `cd [directory_name]`: To change the current directory.
- `search [keyword]`: To search for files or directories containing the keyword.

### Examples:

1. **To select a file named `player_stats.csv` for analysis:**
    ```
    select player_stats.csv
    ```
2. **To change the current directory to `2021_season`:**
    ```
    cd 2021_season
    ```
3. **To search for files containing the keyword `tackle`:**
    ```
    search tackle
    ```
